I joined spexor as application development intern in late summer 2020 and supported them as a working student until I completed my bachelor's degree in summer 2022. <br/><br/>spexor was part of Bosch's smart home assortment and was designed for the B2C market. However, it has also been used internally at Bosch in a B2B context. While a private customer typically uses one or two spexor devices, a business customer is more likely to have a large number of spexor devices in use, affecting the usability of the spexor app. Therefore, I researched how the spexor app could be redesigned to suit the needs of business customers.  </p>\n\n        \n        \n        <h4 class=\"uppercase margin-top-48\">P r o c e s s</h4>\n        <p>The project was carried out in four phases: </p>\n        <ul class=\"project-list\">\n        <li class=\"float\"><div class=\"purple uppercase bold font-size-14 padding-right-48 width-30\">E m p a t h i s e</div> <div class=\"width-70\">Here I conducted semi-structured user interviews to learn more about the pain points users faced when using spexor in a B2B context.</div></li>\n        <li class=\"float\"><div class=\"purple uppercase bold font-size-14 padding-right-48 width-30\">D e f i n e</div>  <div class=\"width-70\">After gathering user insights, I analysed the results of the interviews and translated them into requirements.

Joining spexor shortly after its market release, I was able to gain valuable insights into agile workflows and the product development process of an IoT product from an early stage. During this project, I learned above all how to define precise requirements for a software product based on user insights and how to prioritise these appropriately for design iteration. </p>\n        \n\n        <p>\n        <h4 class=\"purple uppercase font-size-12\">Â» T r u s t &nbsp; w h a t &nbsp; y o u r &nbsp; u s e r s &nbsp; d o, &nbsp; n o t &nbsp; w h a t &nbsp; t h e y &nbsp; s a y Â«</h4>\n        {/* <div id=\"quote-author\" class=\"uppercase\">S t e v e &nbsp; J o b s</div> */}\n        </p>\n        <p>This is something I have also found during my user research. During the testing, a user commented on a feature of the user interface as not necessary, which was requested by the same user during the interviews. On the one hand, I understood that asking the right questions and precise phrasing is everything when conducting interviews. On the other hand, observing users using a service or product, rather than asking for their opinion, can often provide more meaningful insights.</p>\n        </div>\n        \n        \n          </section>\n        )\n    }\n}\n\n","/Users/viviengeschwind/Projects/Website/website-professional/src/Hamburger.js",[],"/Users/viviengeschwind/Projects/Website/website-professional/src/components/Gallery.js",["69","70","71","72","73","74","75"],"import React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport IMG1 from '../images/000022.JPG'\nimport IMG2 from '../images/75684944-F66A-4F5E-AC65-B59D53EDF1BA.jpg'\nimport IMG3 from '../images/000017.JPG'\nimport IMG4 from '../images/000002.JPG'\nimport IMG5 from '../images/025_FULL_01_500.jpg'\nimport IMG6 from '../images/000035.jpg'\n\nconst photos = [\n    { src: {IMG1}, width: 800, height: 600 },\n    { src: {IMG2}, width: 1600, height: 900 },\n    { src: {IMG3}, width: 800, height: 600 },\n    { src: {IMG4}, width: 1600, height: 900 }\n  ]\n  \n\nexport default class Gallery extends Component {\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <section>\n          <h2>My life on film</h2>\n          {/* <PhotoAlbum layout=\"rows\" photos={photos} /> */}\n          <div class=\"flex\">\n          <img src={IMG1} width=\"500px\"></img>\n          <img src={IMG2} width=\"500px\"></img>\n          <img src={IMG3} width=\"500px\"></img>\n          <img src={IMG4} width=\"500px\"></img>\n          <img src={IMG5} width=\"500px\"></img>\n          <img src={IMG6} width=\"500px\"></img>\n          </div>\n          </section>\n        )\n    }\n}",["76","77"],{"ruleId":"78","replacedBy":"79"},{"ruleId":"80","replacedBy":"81"},{"ruleId":"82","severity":1,"message":"83","line":2,"column":8,"nodeType":"84","messageId":"85","endLine":2,"endColumn":12},{"ruleId":"86","severity":1,"message":"87","line":59,"column":25,"nodeType":"88","endLine":59,"endColumn":78},{"ruleId":"82","severity":1,"message":"89","line":3,"column":8,"nodeType":"84","messageId":"85","endLine":3,"endColumn":15},{"ruleId":"82","severity":1,"message":"90","line":1,"column":8,"nodeType":"84","messageId":"85","endLine":1,"endColumn":30},{"ruleId":"91","severity":1,"message":"92","line":22,"column":3,"nodeType":"88","endLine":22,"endColumn":72},{"ruleId":"86","severity":1,"message":"87","line":22,"column":72,"nodeType":"88","endLine":22,"endColumn":109},{"ruleId":"86","severity":1,"message":"87","line":23,"column":55,"nodeType":"88","endLine":23,"endColumn":88},{"ruleId":"86","severity":1,"message":"87","line":49,"column":9,"nodeType":"88","endLine":49,"endColumn":38},{"ruleId":"86","severity":1,"message":"87","line":15,"column":15,"nodeType":"88","endLine":15,"endColumn":51},{"ruleId":"82","severity":1,"message":"93","line":9,"column":7,"nodeType":"84","messageId":"85","endLine":9,"endColumn":13},{"ruleId":"86","severity":1,"message":"87","line":24,"column":11,"nodeType":"88","endLine":24,"endColumn":41},{"ruleId":"86","severity":1,"message":"87","line":25,"column":11,"nodeType":"88","endLine":25,"endColumn":41},{"ruleId":"86","severity":1,"message":"87","line":26,"column":11,"nodeType":"88","endLine":26,"endColumn":41},{"ruleId":"86","severity":1,"message":"87","line":27,"column":11,"nodeType":"88","endLine":27,"endColumn":41},{"ruleId":"86","severity":1,"message":"87","line":28,"column":11,"nodeType":"88","endLine":28,"endColumn":41},{"ruleId":"86","severity":1,"message":"87","line":29,"column":11,"nodeType":"88","endLine":29,"endColumn":41},{"ruleId":"78","replacedBy":"94"},{"ruleId":"80","replacedBy":"95"},"no-native-reassign",["96"],"no-negated-in-lhs",["97"],"no-unused-vars","'IMG1' is defined but never used.","Identifier","unusedVar","jsx-a11y/alt-text","img elements must have an alt prop, either with meaningful text, or an empty string for decorative images.","JSXOpeningElement","'Gallery' is defined but never used.","'SocialButtonsContainer' is defined but never used.","react/jsx-no-target-blank","Using target=\"_blank\" without rel=\"noreferrer\" is a security risk: see https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/links.html#link-type-noopener","'photos' is assigned a value but never used.",["96"],["97"],"no-global-assign","no-unsafe-negation"]
