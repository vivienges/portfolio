          <h2>Bosch spexor</h2>
          <div>This project was developed as part of my bachelor's thesis in cooperation with the Robert Bosch start-up spexor. </div>

          <div>Role: Researcher, Designer &amp; Developer</div>
          <div>Tools: Sketch, Xcode</div>
          <div>Duration: 12 weeks</div>
          <p>spexor is a Bosch-branded product that uses smart sensor technology to warn of various (daily) dangers, such as burglaries or air pollution. spexor comprises an IoT device and an app for the smartphone that can be used to manage the device remotely.</p>

        <p>spexor has been designed for the B2C market. However, spexor has been used Bosch-internally in a B2B context.</p>

        <p>For this research, user interviews have been conducted to make sense of spexor how spexor is used in the business environment and to identify pain points. Based on the interviews, a detailed requirements catalogue (that contains both functional and non-functional) has been established.</p>
        
        <h4>Learnings</h4>
        <p>Joining spexor shortly after market release, I was involved in the product development process.</p>
        <p>During my two years at the corporate startup spexor, I was able to gain experience in the startup as well as corporate environment.</p>

          <div>The research results and wireframes cannot be published here due to NDA. Please contact me if you want to know more about this project.</div>
