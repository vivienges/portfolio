During the testing, a user commented on a feature of the user interface as not necessary, which was requested by the same user during the interviews. On the one hand, I understood that asking the right questions and precise phrasing is everything when conducting interviews. On the other hand, observing the user using a service or product instead of asking the user for opinion can often provide more meaningful insights.</p>\n        </div>\n        \n        \n          </section>\n        )\n    }\n}\n\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
